    <p>National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation. National Service Scheme is a student â€“ centered programme and it is complementary to education. It is a noble experiment in academic extension. It inculcates the spirit of voluntary work among students and teachers through sustained community interaction. It brings our academic institutions closer to the society. It is a link between the campus and community, the college and village, knowledge and action. The overall aim of NSS is the Personality Development of students through community service. It gives an extension dimension to Higher Education system and orients the student youth to community service.
        The NSS symbol is embossed on the NSS badge. The NSS volunteers wear it while undertaking any programme of community service.
The Konark wheel in the symbol has eight bars which represent the 24 hours of the day.
The Red colour in the badge indicates that the NSS volunteers are full of blood. i.e. lively, active energetic and full of high spirit.
The Navy Blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is a tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of mankind. NSS was formally launched on 24th September, 1969.

24 September is celebrated every year as NSS Day with appropriate programmes & activities. The logo for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Orissa, India. The Red & Blue colors contained in the logo motivate the NSS Volunteers to be active & energetic for the nation-building social activities. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release and signifies the movement in life across time and space, The wheel thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change. <br><br>
